# FarkleStatsSimulator

**FarkleStatsSimulator** is a Python project for in-depth exploration of probability, combinatorics, statistics, and decision-making strategies in a custom variant of the dice game Farkle.

The main objective is to use simulation and exhaustive combinatorial analysis to answer questions about optimal strategies, risk/reward calculations, and the mathematical expectations of different choices in the game. The project aims to visualize probabilities and game situations with matplotlib, reveal interesting patterns, and provide tools for understanding the underlying math of this Farkle variant.

This repository is less about playing the game, and more about experimenting with the numbers behind itâ€”simulating dice throws, modeling players, and searching for insights about the best decisions in different scenarios.

See [rules.md](./rules.md) for detailed rules, and stay tuned for [insights.md](./insights.md) as discoveries and strategic tips accumulate.
