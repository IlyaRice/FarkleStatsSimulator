# Game Rules

## 1. Game Components

* **Players:** 2 or more.
* **Dice:** 5 standard six-sided dice (d6).
* **Scoring:** Track integer scores for each player.

---

## 2. Game Objective

* The winner is the first player to reach **1,000 or more points**, provided they exit the last barrel according to barrel rules.

---

## 3. Turn Structure

### 3.1. Beginning a Turn

* On their turn, the player rolls all 5 dice.

### 3.2. Scoring Dice

* After any roll, determine all valid scoring combinations present in the rolled dice (see Section 6).
* If **no scoring combinations** are rolled, the player scores 0 points for this turn (bust) and the turn ends.

### 3.3. Selecting Dice to Keep

* If at least one scoring combination is present:

  * The player must set aside **at least one scoring die or combination** from the current roll.
  * The player may choose to set aside any number of scoring dice/combinations from this roll.

### 3.4. Decision: Bank or Continue

* After setting aside at least one scoring die/combination:

  * The player can **end their turn**, adding the turn’s accumulated points to their total score.
  * OR **continue the turn** by rolling the remaining (un-set-aside) dice.
  * If all 5 dice have been set aside, the player may roll all 5 dice again ("hot dice").

### 3.5. Special Rule: Double on Three Dice Aside

* If the player has set aside exactly 3 dice and, with the next roll of the remaining 2 dice, rolls a **double** (e.g., 2-2, 3-3, etc.):

  * The player is allowed to roll all 5 dice again.
  * Doubles of 1-1 and 5-5 also award points per normal scoring.
  * Doubles of 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 6-6 do **not** score points, but allow the 5-dice roll.

### 3.6. End of Turn

* The turn ends when the player:

  * Banks their current points for the turn, or
  * Fails to roll any scoring dice (bust).

## 4. Scoring Combinations

Only dice rolled together in the same throw count toward a combination. Dice set aside from previous rolls do **not** participate in combinations.

| Combination          | Score |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Single 1             | 10    |
| Two 1s               | 20    |
| Three 1s             | 100   |
| Four 1s              | 200   |
| Five 1s              | 1000  |
| Single 5             | 5     |
| Two 5s               | 10    |
| Three 5s             | 50    |
| Four 5s              | 100   |
| Five 5s              | 500   |
| Three 2s             | 20    |
| Four 2s              | 40    |
| Five 2s              | 200   |
| Three 3s             | 30    |
| Four 3s              | 60    |
| Five 3s              | 300   |
| Three 4s             | 40    |
| Four 4s              | 80    |
| Five 4s              | 400   |
| Three 6s             | 60    |
| Four 6s              | 120   |
| Five 6s              | 600   |
| 1-2-3-4-5 (straight) | 125   |
| 2-3-4-5-6 (straight) | 250   |

## 5. Barrel Mechanic (Milestone Checkpoints)

There are **three barrels**:

| Barrel | Entry Score | Exit Score (must exceed) |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 1      | 295         | 400                      |
| 2      | 595         | 700                      |
| 3      | 895         | 1000                     |

* For each barrel, the player is considered “in the barrel” if their total score is **greater than or equal to the Entry Score and less than the Exit Score**.
* Formally:
  **Entry Score ≤ player’s score < Exit Score**
* Example:
  * **First barrel:** 295 ≤ score < 400 — the player is in the barrel.
  * If the player’s score reaches 400 or more, they are no longer in the barrel.
* While in the barrel, the player has **exactly three turns** to reach or exceed the barrel’s Exit Score.
* If the player does not reach or exceed the Exit Score after three turns, the player’s score is **reset to the Entry Score** of the current barrel, and a new 3-turn countdown begins.
* The player remains "in the barrel" until they reach or exceed the Exit Score.

---

## 6. Combination Detection Rules

* A combination is only counted if all dice for it are rolled together in a single throw.
* Dice previously set aside do not participate in future combinations.
* Multiple combinations can be scored from a single roll if dice are not reused between combinations.

---

## 7. Winning the Game

* The first player to reach more than 1000 points and exit the last barrel (by exceeding 1000) wins.

---

## 8. Notes

* If the player, during their turn, uses all 5 dice (through setting aside dice in sequential rolls), they may immediately roll all 5 dice again and continue the turn (with turn points carried over).
* After each bust, the next player’s turn begins.
* The game supports any number of players.
